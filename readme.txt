Allow your sites in a multisite network to share reusable blocks in a hub-and-spoke style.

== Description ==
By default reusable blocks are only available on the site which creates them - which makes perfect sense for a standard installation of WordPress. Shared Reusable Blocks introduces the idea of allowing a site in a Multisite network to become a \'hub\' - affording other \'spoke\' sites in the network the ability to use reusable blocks from the hub site.
